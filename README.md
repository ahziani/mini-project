# Frontend Technical Challenge

Your task is to create a small e-commerce application that demonstrates your ability to build clean, scalable, and maintainable frontend code.

We are not just evaluating the final result, but also how you structure your code, how you approach project architecture, code readability, reusability, state management, and UI/UX implementation. Make sure to apply best practices, follow Angular standards.

**Make sure to share your code with us on GitHub and deploy your application on Vercel. Include a short README.md explaining how to install, run, and test your application**
